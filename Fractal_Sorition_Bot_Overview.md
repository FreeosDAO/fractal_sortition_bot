# üß† Fractal Sortition Bot for OpenChat (Prototype)


## üìñ Overview

**Fractal Sortition Bot** is a prototype governance experiment designed to run within **OpenChat**, a decentralized messaging platform on the Internet Computer. The goal is to explore new mechanisms for fair, scalable, and peer-driven leadership selection using small-group deliberation and random selection ‚Äî inspired by the process known as **Fractal Sortition**.

### üîç What is Fractal Sortition?

Fractal Sortition is a novel approach to decentralized governance that combines:

- **Randomized grouping** of community members into small clusters (e.g., 3‚Äì5 people),
- **Deliberative discussion** within each group on predefined governance topics,
- **Peer voting** to select the most representative or capable individual from each group,
- **Iteration** across multiple rounds, narrowing down candidates,
- And finally, **random sortition** ‚Äî selecting a leader from the final pool of peer-nominated individuals.

This method is inspired by principles of deliberative democracy and aims to reduce popularity contests, token plutocracy, and passive voting behavior often seen in typical DAO systems.

### üí¨ Why OpenChat?

OpenChat provides the perfect testbed for this concept due to:

- Its decentralized nature,
- Built-in group chat and video chat functionality,
- Support for custom bots via a powerful on-chain SDK,
- And its upcoming **DecideID** integration ‚Äî a proof-of-personhood system for verifying unique identities.

By building directly on OpenChat using its **Motoko SDK**, we can prototype a fully on-chain governance layer that encourages grassroots leadership and scalable democratic engagement ‚Äî all within a live chat platform.

### üõ†Ô∏è What This Bot Will Do

The Fractal Sortition bot will:

- Allow users to volunteer as candidates through a simple chat command.
- Randomly assign volunteers into small discussion groups (e.g. 5 per group).
- Provide each group with questions and instructions for timed discussion (e.g. 2 hours).
- Facilitate peer voting within groups to identify promising leaders.
- Build a **shortlist** of top-voted individuals.
- Randomly select one from this shortlist to serve as **delegate** for a 24-hour term.
- Allow users to initiate and vote on **non-confidence petitions** to remove ineffective delegates.
- Rinse and repeat ‚Äî enabling continuous, emergent governance.

This is a proof-of-concept experiment to evaluate how such a process performs in a real-world social setting, using real-time tools and a decentralized identity system.


## üéØ Purpose

Prototype a decentralized and iterative leadership selection process within an OpenChat channel using **Fractal Sortition** ‚Äî involving group discussions, peer selection, shortlist creation, and final random leader selection with accountability mechanisms (non-confidence votes).

## üìå Core Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Volunteer**        | A user opts in via the bot to participate in the next Fractal PlayUp stage. |
| **Fractal PlayUp**   | Small groups discuss/debate; peer-vote selects 1 potential leader per group.|
| **Shortlist**        | The pool of candidates selected in PlayUp stages.                            |
| **Sortition**        | Random selection of 1 delegate from the shortlist for a fixed term.          |
| **Petition/Vote**    | Mechanism to challenge/remove delegate.                                     |

- **Group Size**:
  - 5 per group ideally.
  - 3 per group if only 9‚Äì11 users.
- **Bot Actions**:
  - Randomly assign members to groups.
  - Create group chat with instructions to initiate a video call.

## üß± Technical Specification

### Bot Implementation

- **Language**: Motoko  
- **Platform**: Internet Computer  
- **OpenChat SDK**: Use `motoko` bot examples as base

### Persistence (Canister State)

```motoko
type User = Principal;
type GroupId = Nat;

type Volunteer = { user: User; timestamp: Time };
type Group = { id: GroupId; members: [User]; votes: Map<User, User> };
type Petition = { initiator: User; signers: Set<User> };

var volunteers: [Volunteer];
var groups: Map<GroupId, Group];
var shortlist: [User];
var currentDelegate: ?(User, Time); // (delegate, timestamp)
var activePetition: ?Petition;
```

### Time Handling

* Use `Time.now()` (Motoko‚Äôs `Int`) for scheduling.
* Voting and petition expiry handled via timestamps and periodic checks.
